# Application of Mathematics

This is a repository of a wide range of real-life applications of mathematics.

The `content.yaml` file contains most of the content, written  in
[YAML](https://yaml.org) format. The description of every item (the `text:` key)
is written in [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown). The key of
every item should correspond to a JPG image in the `images/` folder.

An interactive version of the content is available on
[Mathigon](https://mathigon.org/applications).
